## What's this about?
Basically it's my website, hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Why do you have your README only on the website?
I'm not ready to make a fully functional personal website, besides, it has the `github.io` domain, so I would probably link my README to the website.

## How do I work on this website so that I can improve it?
Clone it, use Visual Studio Code (tm), then open the cloned repository.

Then start ~~messing~~working on it!!!

## Uh, can I fork it or modify something that isn't mine?
Yes, you can steal it whatever you want, it's just a website pointing to a GitHub profile readme.
