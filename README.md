## What's this about?
Basically it's my website, hosted on GitHub Pages

There's also [gianxd.ga](https://gianxd.ga), which is a mirrored website of this.

## What's the fallback page?
As of commit [#c6c81dd](https://github.com/gianxddddd/gianxddddd.github.io/commit/c6c81dd409c2c5934fb9c365ebdede0e10b82d66), this website has been re-designed into a much simplier look.

The old UI is now what became to be `Fallback mode`, you can visit Fallback Mode [here.](https://gianxddddd.github.io/fallback)

## How do I work on this website so that I can improve it?
Clone it, use Visual Studio Code, then open the cloned repository.

Then start messing or working on it!!!

## Uh, can I fork it or modify something that isn't mine?
Yes, you can steal it whatever you want.
