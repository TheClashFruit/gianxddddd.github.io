# gianxddddd.github.io
## What's this about?
Basically it's my website, hosted on GitHub Pages

There's also [gianxd.ga](https://gianxd.ga), which is a mirrored website of this.

## How do I work on this website so that I can improve it?
Clone it, use Visual Studio Code, then open the cloned repository.

Then start messing or working on it!!!

## Uh, can I fork it or modify something that isn't mine?
Yes, you can steal it whatever you want.
